# Overview {.unnumbered}

## Overview
This EEG signal analysis program is designed to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for processing and analyzing EEG data in the context of clinical trials and studies. It leverages the power of open-source libraries, such as MNE, to offer a robust and flexible framework for clinical EEG analysis.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Perform standard EEG preprocessing tasks, including filtering, artifact detection and removal, and channel selection.
- **Event Detection and Segmentation**: Accurately identify and segment EEG events of interest, such as evoked responses, oscillatory activity, and sleep stages.
- **Signal Analysis**: Apply a wide range of signal processing techniques, including time-domain analysis, frequency-domain analysis, and time-frequency analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical tests to assess the significance of EEG findings, including group comparisons and correlations with clinical outcomes.
- **Visualization**: Generate informative visualizations, such as topographic maps, time-series plots, and spectrograms, to facilitate data exploration and presentation.
- **Integration with Clinical Data**: Seamlessly integrate EEG data with other clinical measures, such as cognitive assessments, behavioral observations, and medical records, to enable multimodal analysis.
- **Scalable and Automated Workflows**: Develop and deploy scalable and automated workflows to handle large-scale clinical datasets efficiently.
- **Reproducibility and Collaboration**: Ensure the reproducibility of analyses and enable collaborative work through the use of version control and documented workflows.
