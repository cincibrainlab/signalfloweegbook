# SignalFlowEEG MEEG Signal Analysis for Clinical Trials

Book: [Online eBook](https://cincibrainlab.github.io/signalfloweegbook/)

## Overview
This EEG signal analysis program is designed to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for processing and analyzing EEG data in the context of clinical trials and studies. It leverages the power of open-source libraries, such as MNE, to offer a robust and flexible framework for clinical EEG analysis.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Perform standard EEG preprocessing tasks, including filtering, artifact detection and removal, and channel selection.
- **Event Detection and Segmentation**: Accurately identify and segment EEG events of interest, such as evoked responses, oscillatory activity, and sleep stages.
- **Signal Analysis**: Apply a wide range of signal processing techniques, including time-domain analysis, frequency-domain analysis, and time-frequency analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical tests to assess the significance of EEG findings, including group comparisons and correlations with clinical outcomes.
- **Visualization**: Generate informative visualizations, such as topographic maps, time-series plots, and spectrograms, to facilitate data exploration and presentation.
- **Integration with Clinical Data**: Seamlessly integrate EEG data with other clinical measures, such as cognitive assessments, behavioral observations, and medical records, to enable multimodal analysis.
- **Scalable and Automated Workflows**: Develop and deploy scalable and automated workflows to handle large-scale clinical datasets efficiently.
- **Reproducibility and Collaboration**: Ensure the reproducibility of analyses and enable collaborative work through the use of version control and documented workflows.

## Installation
To install the EEG Signal Analysis for Clinical Trials program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
2. Create a new virtual environment using your preferred method (e.g., `virtualenv` or `conda`).
3. Activate the virtual environment.
4. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. (Optional) Install additional packages for specific analysis or visualization needs.

## Usage
1. Import the necessary modules and initialize the analysis pipeline:
   ```python
   import mne
   from eeg_analysis.preprocessing import preprocess_data
   from eeg_analysis.analysis import perform_analysis
   from eeg_analysis.visualization import generate_plots
   ```
2. Load your EEG dataset and associated clinical data:
   ```python
   eeg_data = mne.io.read_raw_edf('clinical_trial_data.edf')
   clinical_data = pd.read_csv('clinical_data.csv')
   ```
3. Preprocess the EEG data:
   ```python
   preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(eeg_data, clinical_data)
   ```
4. Perform the desired analysis:
   ```python
   analysis_results = perform_analysis(preprocessed_data, clinical_data)
   ```
5. Generate visualizations and reports:
   ```python
   generate_plots(analysis_results, clinical_data)
   ```
